What the difference between extends ,with ,implements dart?
--

Extends: if you want to inherit from one class in dart you use Extends
Single Inheritance: When a class inherits a single parent class than this inheritance occurs. 
Multiple Inheritance: When a class inherits more than one parent class 
Dart does not support multiple inheritance

implements:when you want to create the same functions from one class to another class you use (implements) but you have to override all methods ex: class Human to a class student you must implement (override) all methods 

with:when you want to implements more than one class you use (with) rather than implements
